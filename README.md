# html login page connected with database 


1. "login.html": This page is designed to gather login information from users. It likely includes input fields for username and password or any other relevant login credentials. The goal is to create a table in the database to store user information. The report provides more details on this process.

1. "employee.html": This page is intended to display employee information. The information is retrieved from the "Employee" table in the database. The goal is to create a table in the HTML document and populate it with data fetched from the database. The report may contain additional information on how this is implemented.

To set up the project and perform the required tasks, the following steps are outlined:

1. Create and insert data into the "user" table using MySQL Workbench: This involves executing MySQL queries to create the "user" table and insert relevant user information. The report should provide the necessary SQL code for this step.

1. Create and insert data into the "Employee" table using Python: This step involves using Python to interact with the database and insert data into the "Employee" table. The report may contain the Python code required for this task.

1. Connect MySQL with the PHP page: This step focuses on establishing a connection between MySQL (the database) and the PHP page. PHP is commonly used for server-side scripting and can handle database operations. This connection allows fetching data from MySQL and displaying it on the HTML page.

1. Fetch data from MySQL and display it on the HTML page: Once the connection between MySQL and the PHP page is established, the PHP code can retrieve data from the "Employee" table in the database. This data can then be formatted and displayed on the HTML page.

1. Handle connection errors: It's important to implement error-handling mechanisms to deal with any potential connection issues between the PHP page and the MySQL database. This ensures that appropriate feedback or error messages are displayed to the user when necessary.

Additionally, the project may include information on team collaboration, motivation techniques, and time management. The GitHub repository may contain other files such as CSS stylesheets ("empinf.css" and "login.css"), a final report in PDF format ("final report.pdf"), and possibly other HTML files ("tesset.html").

Overall, the project involves creating a login page, establishing a connection between MySQL and PHP, fetching and displaying employee information from the database, and implementing appropriate error handling.
